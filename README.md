# 100DaysOfMLCode

DAY 0: 2018 08/23
Today's Progress:  Retake the machine learning online course and thinking how to planning my next semester.

Thoughts: It's hard to focus on one thing once times. But i think it's time to change or never. I am still have no clean picture about my final semester. I will figure out next week.
